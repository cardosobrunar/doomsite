  <h1>Emotional Support</h1>
  <p>If League of Legends is starting to take a toll on your emotions, you're not alone. It's okay to take breaks, ask for help, and talk about how you feel.</p>

  <h2>Ways to Take Care of Yourself</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Set Limits:</strong> Try not to play for long stretches. Use timers or schedules to help you balance gaming and other responsibilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Talk to Friends:</strong> Connecting with teammates or friends can be a great way to vent or get encouragement.</li>
    <li><strong>Step Away When Tilted:</strong> If you’re frustrated or upset, it’s okay to log off. Breathe. Stretch. Walk.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice Self-Compassion:</strong> You’re not defined by your rank. Be kind to yourself—mistakes are part of learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Reach Out:</strong> If things feel overwhelming, don’t hesitate to speak to a counselor or someone you trust.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>You matter more than any match. Be kind to your mind, Summoner.</em></p>
